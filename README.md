# Neural-Style-Transfer
In this academic project we aim to implement, analyse and compare different results obtained using neural style transfer techniques with different models. More specifically we used and compared 3 different models: VGG16, VGG19 and ResNet50. 
For more information, I invite you to read the paper we have produced.
